# Movable dialogs

Based on tipsy's solution, found in the Vuetify issue : https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/4058.
Since it is a basic solution with only native JS, the solution works with every framework.

This repo is an exemple of integration with Vue3, Vuetify 3 and TypeScript with some additions like a move cursor or the emptied selection while moving the dialog.
